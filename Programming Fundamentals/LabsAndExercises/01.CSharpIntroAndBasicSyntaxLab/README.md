# Lab: C# Intro and Basic Syntax

## Problem 1. Greeting

Write a program, which greets the user by their name, which it reads from the console.

### Step 1. Create a New C# Project, using Visual Studio

Open Visual Studio and create a new project by going into [File -> New -> Project].
 
After that, the project creation window will open.
Select Visual C#, then Console Application and name it appropriately/
 
### Step 2. Write the Program Logic

A new file opens in the editor, which looks like this.
  
Let’s write the program logic. We want to read a name and then print that name with some additional text on the console. To accomplish this, we’ll use Console.ReadLine() and Console.WriteLine().
 
### Step 3. Test the Program

After we wrote the program logic, we can start our program, using [Ctrl+F5].
 
Let’s type in a name and see if it works.
 
If you followed all the steps correctly, you should be greeted by your program! Submit the code in Judge and test if it works correctly.

### Examples

|Input	|Output       |
|:---   |:---         |
|Pesho	|Hello, Pesho!|
|Ivan	|Hello, Ivan! |
|Merry	|Hello, Merry!|

## Problem 2. Add Two Numbers

Write a program, which reads 2 whole numbers and adds them together. Then, print them in the following format: 

	• “a + b = sum”

### Step 1. Create a New C# Project Inside the Solution

In Visual Studio, create a new project in our current solution by right clicking the solution in the Solution Explorer and navigating to [Add -> New Project…].
 
After that, name it appropriately and hit [OK].

### Step 2. Change the Startup Project

Now that you’ve created a new project inside the solution, you need to set the startup project to the currently selected project, otherwise whenever you hit [Ctrl+F5], the previous problem will start. So right click the solution and hit “Set Startup Projects”.
  	 
Now we’re ready to write our logic.

### Examples

|Input	|Output    |
|:---   |:---      |
|2      |2 + 5 = 7 |
|5	|          |
|-------|----------|
|1      |1 + 3 = 4 |
|3	|          |
|-------|----------|
|-3     |-3 + 5 = 2|
|5	|          |

## Problem 3. Employee Data

Write a program to read data about an employee and print it on the console with the appropriate formatting. The order the input comes in is as such:

	• Name – no formatting
	• Age – no formatting
	• Employee ID – 8-digit padding (employee id 356 is 00000356)
	• Monthly Salary – formatted to 2 decimal places (2345.56789 becomes 2345.56)

### Examples

|Input	  |Output                |
|:---     |:---                  |
|Ivan     |Name: Ivan            |
|24       |Age: 24               |
|1192     |Employee ID: 00001192 |
|1500.353 |Salary: 1500.35       |
|---------|----------------------|
|Peter    |Name: Peter           |
|30       |Age: 30               |
|113236   |Employee ID: 00113236 |
|1738.1112|Salary: 1738.11       |
|---------|----------------------|
|Naiden   |Name: Naiden          |
|27       |Age: 27               |
|1111222  |Employee ID: 01111222 |
|3560	  |Salary: 3560.00       |

### Hints

	• You can use “D” and “F” to format numbers in C#. You can read more about formatting strings here.
