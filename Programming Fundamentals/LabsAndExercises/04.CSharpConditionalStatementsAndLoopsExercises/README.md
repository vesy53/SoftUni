#  Exercises: C# Conditional Statements and Loops

## Problem 1. Choose a Drink

Write a program, which receives a profession (as a string) and chooses the perfect drink for the person. The possible combinations are: 

	• “Water” – for “Athlete”
	• “Coffee” – for “Businessman” or “Businesswoman”
	• “Beer” – for “SoftUni Student”
	• “Tea” – for all other professions.

### Examples

|Input	 |Output|
|:---    |:---  |		
|Athlete |Water	|	
|Doctor	 |Tea   |
	
## Problem 2. Choose a Drink 2.0

Your program needs to get smarter. Now you will receive on the second line the quantities of the drink and you have to print the calculated the price. You can see the prices of the drinks in the table below:

|	|Water	|Coffee	|Beer	|Tea  |
|:---   |:---   |:---   |:---   |:--- |
|Price	|0.70	|1.00	|1.70	|1.20 |

Input

The input will be on two lines:

	• On the first line, you will receive the profession
	• On the second line, you will receive the quantity as an integer. 

### Output

Print the output in the following format:
**The** **{profession}** **has** **to** **pay** **{totalPrice}.**

Format the price to the 2nd decimal place.

### Examples

|Input	         |Output                               |
|:---            |:---                                 |
|Athlete         |The Athlete has to pay 0.70.         |
|1               |	                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
|SoftUni Student |The SoftUni Student has to pay 13.60 |
|8	         |                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
|Chef            |The Chef has to pay 3.60.            |
|3	         |                                     |

## Problem 3. Restaurant Discount

A restaurant want to automate their reservation process. They need a program that reads the hall and the count of people from the console and calculates how much the customer should pay to book the place.
Different halls have different prices:

|	  |Small Hall	|Terrace   |Great Hall |
|:---     |:---         |:---      |:---       |
|Price	  |    2500$	|  5000$   |  7500$    |
|Capacity |	50	|   100	   |   120     |

The restaurant has discounts depending on the service package, which the group wants. 
 You can see the discounts in the table below:

|	  |Normal  |Gold  |Platinum  |
|:---     |:---    |:---  |:---      |
|Discount |  5%	   | 10%  |  15%     |
|Price	  | 500$   | 750$ | 1000$    |

You should add the price of the package to the price of the hall. The discount is calculated based on the hall’s price + package’s price.

Example: The group has 10 people and wants the gold package -> $292.50 per person:

	• 10 people <= 50 ? they get the Small Hall ? $2500
	• Gold package ? $750, 10% discount on the entire purchase
	• Total price: $2500 + $750 = $3250
	• Discount: $3250 - 10% discount = $2925
	• Price per person: $2925 / 10 people = $292.50 per 

You should print which hall is the most suitable for the group and the price per person. If the group is bigger than 120 people – print “We do not have an appropriate hall.”.

### Input

	• First line: the group size as an integer
	• Second line: the package as a string

### Output

Print the output in the following format:

**We** **can** **offer** **you** **the** **{hallName}**
**The** **price** **per** **person** **is** **{price}$**

Format the price to the 2nd decimal place.

### Examples

|Input	  |Output                                  |
|:---     |:---                                    |
|20       |We can offer you the **Small** **Hall** |
|Gold	  |The price per person is **146.25$**     |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
|90       |We can offer you the **Terrace**        |
|Platinum |The price per person is **56.67$**	   |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
|150      |We do not have an appropriate hall.     |
|Normal	  |                                        |

## Problem 4. Hotel

A hotel has three types of rooms: studio, double and master suite. The prices are different for the different months: 

|**May** **and** **October**|**June** **and** **September**|**July,** **August** **and** **December**|
|:---                       |:---                          |:---                       |
|Studio - 50 leva per night |Studio - 60 leva per night	   |Studio - 68 leva per night |
|Double - 65 leva per night |Double - 72 leva per night	   |Double - 77 leva per night |
|Suite - 75 leva per night  |Suite - 82 leva per night	   |Suite - 89 leva per night  |

They have also the following discounts: 

	• For studio and more than 7 nights in May and October: 5% discount
	• For double and more than 14 nights in June and September: 10% discount
	• For suite and more than 14 nights in July, August and December: 15% discount
	• For studio and more than 7 nights in September and October: one night is free

### Input

The input consists of exactly 2 lines:

	• First line: Month – May, June, July, August, September, October or December
	• Second line: Nights Count – an integer between [0 ... 200]

### Output

Print 3 lines on the console:

	• On the first: “Studio: {price for the stay} lv.”
	• On the second: “Double: {price for the stay} lv.”
	• On the third: “Suite: {price for the stay} lv.”

Format the prices to the 2nd decimal place.

### Examples

|Input	|Output	           |Comment                                                    |

|June   |Studio: 300.00 lv.|The nights are not enough for getting a discount, so the   |
|5      |Double: 360.00 lv.|studio is 60 lv, double room = 72 and apartment = 82. We   |
|       |Suite: 410.00 lv. |multiply the prices by the nights and get the total prices.|
|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|May    |Studio: 475.00 lv.|In May, we have a discount of 5%, when the nights are more |
|10	|Double: 650.00 lv.|than 7. That means the price for night in the studios is   |
|       |Suite: 750.00 lv. |50 * 0.95 = 47.5. Again, we multiply the prices by the nights| 
|       |                  |and get the total prices.                                  |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

## Problem 12. Test Numbers

Write a program, which finds all the possible combinations between two numbers – N and M.
The first digit decreases from N to 1, and the second digit increases from 1 to M. The two digits form a number. Multiply the two digits, then multiply their product by 3. Add the result to the total sum. 
You will also be given a third number, which will be the maximum boundary of the sum. If the sum is equal or greater than this number you should stop the program. See the examples for further information. 

### Input

The input is read from the console and consists of three lines: 

	• First line – N – integer in the interval [1…100]
	• Second line – M – integer in the interval [1…100]
	• Third line – maximum sum boundary – integer in the interval [1…1000000]

### Output

The output depends on the result:

	• If the sum is equal or greater than the maximum sum:
		o "{count of combinations} combinations"
		o "Sum: {sum from the combinations} >= {maximum sum}"
	• If the sum is less than the maximum sum:
		o "{count of combinations} combinations"
		o "Sum: {sum from the combinations}"

### Examples

|Input | Output  	|Comments                                                       |

## Problem 13.	Game of Numbers

Write a program, which finds all possible combinations in the interval between two numbers. The program should also find the last combination, in which a number’s digits are equal to a given magical number.

### Input

The input is read from the console and consists of three lines: 

	• First line – N – integer in the interval [1…999]
	• Second line – M – integer in the interval [N…1000]
	• Third line – magical number – integer in the interval [1…10000]

### Output

The output depends on the result:

	• If there is a number with digits equal to the magical number:
		o "Number found! {first number} + {second number} = {magical number}"
	• If such combination does not exist:

## Problem 14. * Magic Letter

Write a program, which prints all 3-letter combinations, using only the letters from a given interval. You will also receive a third letter. Every combination, which contains this letter should not be printed.

### Input

The input is read from the console and consists three lines: 

	• First line – lower case English letter from ‘a’ to ‘z’
	• Second line – lower case English letter from ‘a’ to ‘z’
	• Third line – lower case English letter from ‘a’ to ‘z’ – combinations, containing this letter should not be printed

### Output

Print all combinations on a single line.

## Problem 15. * Neighbour Wars

Gosho and Pesho are neighbours, but they don’t like each other very much. They don’t like violence as well, so they decided they need a save environment where they can fight each other. They hired you to write a program, which calculates who would win the fight. 
Gosho and Pesho have their own signature attacks – Gosho attacks with “Thunderous fist” on every even turn of the game and Pesho attacks with “Roundhouse kick” on every odd turn. You will receive how much damage these attacks do from the console.
Both players start with 100 Health points. On every third turn Pesho and Gosho restore 10 Health Points. Health points are restored after the attack is made.
When one of the player’s health is below or equal to zero you should stop any other further operations and print who the winner is, how much health points he has and in which turn he won. Since Mike Tyson is the judge of the match, the winning round is always printed with “th” in the end.

### Input

The input is read from the console and consists of two lines:

	• First line – Pesho’s damage
	• Second line – Gosho’s damage

### Output

Print on every turn who is attacking and how much health the opponent is after the attack:
"{name of the attacker} used {name of the attack} and reduced {name of the defending player} to {health of the defending player} health."
When one of the players is dead print:
"{name of the winner} won in {number of the round}th round."

### Constraints

	• Pesho’s damage and Gosho’s damage will be integers in the interval [0…100]
	• There will always be a winner
