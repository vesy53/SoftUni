# Exercises: Lists

## 1. Max Sequence of Equal Elements

Read a list of integers and find the longest sequence of equal elements. If several exist, print the leftmost.

#### Examples

Input	                   |Output
:---                       |:---
3 4 4 **5** **5** **5** 2 2|5 5 5
**7** **7** 4 4 5 5 3 3    |7 7
1 2 **3** **3**            |3 3

### Hints
	• Scan positions p from left to right and keep the start and length of the current sequence of equal numbers ending at p.
	• Keep also the currently best (longest) sequence (bestStart + bestLength) and update it after each step.

## 2. Change List

Write a program, which reads a list of integers from the console and receives commands, which manipulate the list. Your program may receive the following commands: 

	• Delete {element} – delete all elements in the array, which are equal to the given element
	• Insert {element} {position} – insert element and the given position

You should stop the program when you receive the command Odd or Even. If you receive Odd ? print all odd numbers in the array separated with single whitespace, otherwise print the even numbers.

#### Examples

|Input	        |Output|      
|:---           |:---  |       
|1 2 3 4 5 5 5 6|1 3   |       
|Delete 5       |      |       
|Insert 10 1    |      |       
|Delete 5       |      |       
|Odd            |      |   
|------------------------------|-------------------|   
|20 12 4 319 21 31234 2 41 23 4|20 12 50 50 31234 2| 
|Insert 50 2                   |                   |
|Insert 50 5                   |                   |
|Delete 4                      |                   |
|Even                          |                   |   
                 
## 3. Search for a Number

On the first line, you will receive a list of integers. On the next line, you will receive an array with exactly three numbers. First number represents the number of elements you have to take from the list (starting from the first one). Second number represents the number of elements you have to delete from the numbers you took (starting from the first one). Last number is the number we search in our collection after the manipulations. If it is present print: “YES!”, otherwise print “NO!”. 

#### Examples

|Input	    |Output|	 
|:---       |:---  |   
|1 2 3 4 5 6|YES!  |     
|5 2 3	    |	   |  
|-----------------------------|------|   
|12 412 123 21 654 34 65 3 23 |NO!   |
|7 4 21	                      |      |

## 4. ** Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

Read a list of integers and find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). If several such exist, print the leftmost.

#### Examples

|Input	                                                        |Output        |
|:---                                                           |:---          |
|**1**	                                                        |1             |
|7 **3** **5** 8 -1 0 6 7	                                |3 5 6 7       |
|**1** **2** 5 **3** **5** 2 4 1	                        |1 2 3 5       |
|**0** 10 20 30 30 40 **1** 50 **2** **3** **4** **5** **6**	|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 |
|11 12 13 **3** 14 **4** 15 **5** **6** **7** **8** 7 **16** 9 8|3 4 5 6 7 8 16|
|**3** 14 **5** 12 15 **7** **8** **9** **11** 10 1	        |3 5 7 8 9 11  |

### Hints
	• Assume we have n numbers in an array nums[0…n-1].
	• Let len[p] holds the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at position p.
	• In a for loop, we shall calculate len[p] for p = 0 … n-1 as follows:
		o Let left is the leftmost position on the left of p (left < p), such that len[left] is the largest possible.
		o Then, len[p] = 1 + len[left]. If left does not exist, len[p] = 1.
		o Also, save prev[p] = left (we hold if prev[] the previous position, used to obtain the best length for position p).
	• Once the values for len[0…n-1] are calculated, restore the LIS starting from position p such that len[p] is maximal and go back and back through p = prev[p].
	• The table below illustrates these computations:

|**index** |0    |1	|2    |3       |4	   |5	   |6	     |7	         |8	        |9	       |10   |

## 5. * Array Manipulator

Write a program that reads an array of integers from the console and set of commands and executes them over the array. The commands are as follows:

	• add <index> <element> – adds element at the specified index (elements right from this position inclusively are shifted to the right).
	• addMany <index> <element 1> <element 2> … <element n> – adds a set of elements at the specified index.
	• contains <element> – prints the index of the first occurrence of the specified element (if exists) in the array or -1 if the element is not found.
	• remove <index> – removes the element at the specified index.
	• shift <positions> – shifts every element of the array the number of positions to the left (with rotation).
		o For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> shift 2 -> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
	• sumPairs – sums the elements in the array by pairs (first + second, third + fourth, …).
		o For example, [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] -> [3, 9, 13, 8].
	• print – stop receiving more commands and print the last state of the array.

print	    |                     |

## 6. Sum Reversed Numbers

Write a program that reads sequence of numbers, reverses their digits, and prints their sum.

#### Examples

|Input	          |Output|Comments                       |
|:---             |:--- |:---                            |
|123 234 12	  |774	|321 + 432 + 21 = 774            |
|12 12 34 84 66 12|220	|21 + 21 + 43+ 48 + 66 + 21 = 220|
|120 1200 12000	  |63	|21 + 21 + 21 = 63               |


## 7. Bomb Numbers

Write a program that reads sequence of numbers and special bomb number with a certain power. Your task is to detonate every occurrence of the special bomb number and according to its power his neighbors from left and right. Detonations are performed from left to right and all detonated numbers disappear. Finally print the sum of the remaining elements in the sequence.

#### Examples

|Input	        |Output|	Comments                                                      |
|:---           |:---  |:---                                                                  |
|1 2 2 4 2 2 2 9|12    |Special number is 4 with power 2. After detontaion                    |
|4 2		|      |we left with the sequence [1, 2, 9] with sum 12.                      |
|---------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1 4 4 2 8 9 1  |5     |Special number is 9 with power 3. After detontaion we left            |
|9 3	        |      |with the sequence [1, 4] with sum 5. Since the 9 has only 1           |
|               |      |neighbour from the right we remove just it (one number instead of 3). |
|---------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1 7 7 1 2 3    |6     |Detonations are performed from left to right. We could not detonate   |
|7 1		|      |the second occurance of 7 because its already destroyed by the first  |
|               |      |occurance. The numbers [1, 2, 3] survive. Their sum is 6.             |
|---------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1|4 |The red and yellow numbers disappear in two sequential detonations.   |
|2 1	        |      |The result is the sequence [1, 1, 1, 1]. Sum = 4.                     |
