# Lab: Conditional Statements and Loops

## Problem 1. Passed

Write a program, which takes as an input a grade and prints “Passed!” if the grade is equal or more than 3.00.

### Input

The input comes as a single floating-point number.

### Output

The output is either "Passed!" if the grade is equal or more than 3.00, otherwise you should print nothing.

### Examples

|Input	|Output	     |
|:---   |:---        |
|5.32	|Passed!     |	
|2.34	|(no output) |

### Solution

We need to take as an input a floating-point number from the console. We will use double.Parse() to convert string to double, which we receive from Console.ReadLine(). After that we compare the grade with 3.00 and prints the result only if the condition returns true.
 
## Problem 2. Passed or Failed

Modify the above program, so it will print "Failed!" if the grade is lower than 3.00.

### Input

The input comes as a single double number.

### Output

The output is either "Passed!" if the grade is more than 2.99, otherwise you should print "Failed!".

### Examples

|Input  |Output  |
|:---   |:---    |
|5.32	|Passed! |		
|2.36	|Failed! |

### Solution

Again, we need to take floating-point number from the console. After that print in the else statement the appropriate message.
 
## Problem 3. Back in 30 Minutes

Every time Stamat tries to pay his bills he sees on the cash desk the sign: "I will be back in 30 minutes". One day Stamat was sick of waiting and decided he needs a program, which prints the time after 30 minutes. That way he won’t have to wait on the desk and come at the appropriate time. He gave the assignment to you, so you have to do it. 

### Input

The input will be on two lines. On the first line, you will receive the hours and on the second you will receive the minutes. 

### Output

Print on the console the time after 30 minutes. The result should be in format hh:mm. The hours have one or two numbers and the minutes have always two numbers (with leading zero).

### Constraints

	• The hours will be between 0 and 23.
	• The minutes will be between 0 and 59.

### Examples

|Input	|Output	|
|:---   |:---   |			
|1      |2:16   |
|46	|       |
|-------|-------|		
|0      |0:31   |
|01	|	|	
|-------|-------|
|23     |0:29   |
|59	|       |
|-------|-------|		
|11     |11:38	|
|08	|       |
|-------|-------|	
|11     |12:02  |
|32	|       |

### Hints

	• Add 30 minutes to the initial minutes, which you receive from the console. If the minutes are more than 59 – increase the hours with 1 and decrease the minutes with 60. The same way check if the hours are more than 23. When you print check for leading zero.

## Problem 4. Month Printer

Write a program, which takes an integer from the console and prints the corresponding month. If the number is more than 12 or less than 1 print "Error!".

### Input

You will receive a single integer on a single line.

### Output

If the number is within the boundaries print the corresponding month, otherwise print "Error!".

### Examples

|Input	|Output	  |
|:---   |:---     |	
|2	|February |		
|13	|Error!   |
 
## Problem 5. Foreign Languages

Write a program, which prints the language, that a given country speaks. You can receive only the following combinations: English is spoken in England and USA; Spanish is spoken in Spain, Argentina and Mexico; for the others, we should print "unknown".

### Input

You will receive a single country name on a single line.

### Output

Print the language, which the country speaks, or if it is unknown for your program, print "unknown".

### Examples

|Input	 |Output  |
|:---    |:---    |		
|USA	 |English |		
|Germany |unknown |

### Hint

Think how you can merge multiple cases, in order to avoid writing more code than you need to.

## Problem 6. Theatre Promotions

A theatre is doing a ticket sale, but they need a program to calculate the price of a single ticket. If the given age does not fit one of the categories, you should print "Error!".  You can see the prices in the table below:

|Day / Age |0 <= age <= 18 |18 < age <= 64  |64 < age <= 122 |
|:---      |:---           |:---            |:---            |
|Weekday   |	12$	   |     18$	    |     12$        |
|Weekend   |	15$	   |     20$	    |     15$        |
|Holiday   |	5$	   |     12$	    |     10$        |

### Input

The input comes in two lines. On the first line, you will receive the type of day. On the second – the age of the person.

### Output

Print the price of the ticket according to the table, or "Error!" if the age is not in the table.

### Constraints

	• The age will be in the interval [-1000…1000].
	• The type of day will always be valid. 

### Examples

|Input	  |Output |
|:---     |:---   |			
|Weekday  |18$    |
|42	  |	  |	
|---------|-------|
|Holiday  |Error! |
|-12	  |	  |	
|---------|-------|
|Holiday  |5$     |
|15	  |	  |	
|---------|-------|
|Weekend  |15$    |
|122	  |       |

#### Step 1. Read the Input

We need to read two lines. First one will be the type of day. We will convert it to lower case letters with the method “ToLower()”. After that, we will read the age of the person and declare a variable – price, which we will use to set the price of the ticket.
 
#### Step 2. Add if-else Statements for the Different Types of Day

For every type of day, we will need to add different cases to check the age of the person and set the price. Some of the age groups have equal prices for the same type of day. This means we can use logical operators to merge some of the conditions.
 
Think where and how you can use logical operators for the other cases.

#### Step 3. Print the result

We can check if the price has a value different, than the initial one. It it does, that means we got a valid combination of day and age and the price of the ticket is saved in the price variable. If the price has a value of 0, then none of the cases got hit, therefore we have to print the error message.
 
## Problem 7. Divisible by 3

Write a program, which prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, which are divisible by 3. You have to use a single for loop. The program should not receive input.
 
## Problem 8. Sum of Odd Numbers

Write a program that prints the next n odd numbers (starting from 1) and on the last row prints the sum of them.

### Input

On the first line, you will receive a number – n. This number shows how many odd numbers you should print.

### Output

Print the next n odd numbers, starting from 1, separated by new lines. On the last line, print the sum of these numbers.

### Constraints

	• n will be in the interval [1…100]

Examples

|Input	|Output	 |
|:---   |:---    |	
|5	|1       |
|       |3       |
|       |5       |
|       |7       |
|       |9       |
|       |Sum: 25 |
|-------|--------|		
|3	|1       |
|       |3       |
|       |5       |
|       |Sum: 9  |
 
## Problem 9. Multiplication Table

You will receive an integer as an input from the console. Print the 10 times table for this integer. See the examples below for more information.

### Output

{theInteger} X {times} = {product}

### Constraints

	• The integer will be in the interval [1…100]

### Examples

|Input	|Output	     |Input	|Output	     |	
|:---   |:---        |:---      |:---        |
|5	|5 X 1 = 5   |2	        |2 X 1 = 2   |
|       |5 X 2 = 10  |          |2 X 2 = 4   |

## Problem 11. Odd Number

Take as an input an odd number and print the absolute value of it. If the number is even, print "Please write an odd number." and continue reading numbers.

### Input

You will receive even integers until you receive an odd number.

### Output

Print "Please write an odd number." if the received number is even. If the number is odd – "The number is: {number}".

### Constraints

	• You will receive maximum 10 numbers
	• The numbers will be in the interval [-1000…1000]

### Examples

|Input |Output	                    |
|:---  |:---                        |	   
|2     |Please write an odd number. |
|4     |Please write an odd number. |
|5     |The number is: 5            |
|------|----------------------------|
|-7    |The number is: 7            |

## Problem 12. Number checker

Write a program, which reads an input from the console and prints "It is a number." if it’s a number. If it is not write "Invalid input!"

### Input

You will receive a single line of input.

### Output

Print one of the messages, but without throwing an exception.

### Examples

|Input	|Output		 |
|:---   |:---            |
|5	|It is a number. |		
|five	|Invalid input!  |

### Hints

You can use a try-catch block to prevent throwing an exception.
